## Pia ManciniðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

Pia Mancini is the co-founder and Chair of Democracy Earth Foundation. She is a committed democracy activist and open source maven, co-founding Open Collective (New York) and the politcal party El Partido de la Red in (Argentina). A World Economic Forum member and TED Talker reaching more than one million viewers, Pia is pioneering nothing less than a reboot of democracy for the internet age, where blockchain-based governance will crate an incorruptible, transparent system of governance that rethinks representation using the tools of liquid democracy. 

Pia is driven by the deep belief that we are 21st century citizens struggling to interact with institutions designed in the 19th century using technology from the 15th century, and the conviction that it is up to digital natives to reboot the world's political and economic systems for the internet generation.
