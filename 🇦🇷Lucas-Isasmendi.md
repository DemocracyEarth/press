In Lucas' world, developer is shorthand for: disruptor, coder, blockchainer, self-learner, decentralizer, entrepreneur, dreamer, and maker. You can share his learning path at his [open source repo]( https://github.com/LucasIsasmendi/portfolio).

Born in Argentina, Lucas has lived most recently in Berlin, New York and currently Paris. Before joining the Democracy Earth team, Lucas spent six years in IT consulting and four years as a solopreneur and startup co-founder.  Following a year in blockchain development with Lisk, he is currently in digital nomad mode. You can find his open source contributions to the Democracy Earth Sovereign platform [here](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign/graphs/contributors) where his work spans the creation of a RESTful API, dApp with liquid democracy smart contract implementation, and the [2017 CE Election Civil Referendum](https://medium.com/open-source-politics/how-the-umbrella-movement-sparked-new-concerns-for-democracy-in-hong-kong-49b3af23c928).
