## Agatha Bacelar🇧🇷🇺🇸

A graduate of Standford D.School, Agatha Bacelar is a multimedia producer at [Emerson Collective](http://www.emersoncollective.com/our-team), where she creates content to inform and move audiences around Emerson’s social justice initiatives, motivated by her belief that "the true measure of our character and our commitment to justice is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.” At Democracy Earth Foundation Agatha works to advance community understanding of liquid democracy and political self-sovereignty through blockchain-based governance software tools and design.  While studying Product Design at Stanford University, Agatha crafted her design sensibility around becoming a true global citizen. As a Brazilian-American with a special interest and aptitude for language 🇩🇪🇵🇹🇨🇳🇪🇸🇺🇸, Agatha has  completed a number of internships abroad, studying education in Kenya, international relations in Brazil, manufacturing in China, and affordable sanitation hygiene in India and Cambodia.   She helped start one of this country’s first collegiate competitive jump rope teams, competed nationally, and was featured in a nationally aired Red Bull video with fellow Double Dutch jumpers.
