## Eduardo MedinaðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª

Eduardo is a [software engineer](https://github.com/medied) bringing his development and international team leadership skills to Democracy Earth Foundation's vision for a peer to peer democracy built on blockchain voting. Having previously worked in the edtech field, Eduardo acknowledges education and democracy go hand in hand. He became more and more involved in the crypto space after participating in a couple of bitcoin hackathons ([Bcoin hackathon](https://blog.purse.io/bcoin-hackathon-bitcoin-for-your-thoughts-3b7e7c067970), [Money 20/20](https://insidebitcoins.com/news/bitcoin-payment-api-developers-win-money-2020-hackathon/26172)) while at the same time becoming more involved in an opensource project like [Sovereign](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign). Now Eduardo can be found working in development scrums, smart contracts, and engaging regularly with the active Democracy Earth community.

As a member of the [Venezuelan diaspora](https://words.democracy.earth/blockchain-and-the-venezuelan-diaspora-383ec282c70), Eduardo brings to the foundation a valuable [personal perspective](https://words.democracy.earth/venezuelas-initial-country-offering-ef45de49aea4) to the geopolitical promise of blockchains to make borderless, incorruptible digital democracy a 21st century reality.  Eduardo has an engineering background, is fluently bilingual and today lives and works in New York.
