## Andrey Bugayevsky ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
Andrey received his Masters in physics in 2012 and immediately began his digital career, starting in marketing and PR and migrating to product and project management, coaching and operations with software development teams. He was an activist during the democratic reform movement that swept Ukraine during 2014, and one of the first orgnaizers of the Ukraine faction of Code Clube (now IT2SCHOOL), in Odessa and the surrounding region, a project that provides free IT education for kids from 8 to 16 years old. 

As the blockchain movement took off in 2016 Andrey could be found in the vanguard, focusing his efforts on investor relations, token sale implementation management, and guerilla marketing, and was instrumental in helpng projects such as Rentberry meet their raise goals ($30M) in record time. The search for a blockchain solution that will bring electoral transparency and liquid democracy to his home country led Andrey to join Democracy Earth in 2017 as a board member and firestarter, bringing his token sale management and marketing expertise to the foundaton's Initial Coin Offering undertaking of 2018. Today Andrey is based in VietNam and dedicating himself fulltime to the  mission of spreading digital democracy around the world. Reach Andrey on Telegram @AndreyBugaevski.
