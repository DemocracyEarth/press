## About Democracy Earth Foundation 

[Democracy Earth Foundation (DEF)](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/) is a U.S. (CA) 501(c)(3) non-profit  building a blockchain-based open source governance platform.  DEF was founded and is led by World Economic Forum member, TED Talker/democracy activist [Pia Mancini (Argentina - New York] (https://www.piamancini.com/), developer/social ‘hacktivist’ [Santiago Siri (Argentina - New York)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santisiri/) and serial Silicon Valley founder/social entrepreneur [Herb Stephens (San Francisco)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/herb-stephens-56b0b21/).  DEF is backed by Silicon Valley accelerators [Fast Forward](https://www.ffwd.org/blog/democracy-earth/) and [Y Combinator (Class of YC15)](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/), which Marc Andreessen (Andreessen Horowitz) calls “the best program for creating top-end entrepreneurs that has ever existed.”  Democracy Earth was named Global Grand Challenge Winner, Governance Category by Google’s Singularity University, as well as a finalist in [Fast Company’s 2017 World Changing Ideas](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062386/democracy-is-getting-a-reboot-on-the-blockchain).  In 2017 Santiago Siri was named a 35 Under 35 [Visionary of the Year by MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.es/listas/35-innovadores-con-menos-de-35/2017/visionarios/santiago-siri-argentina).

Democracy Earth Foundation has its beginnings in DemocracyOS co-founded in 2012 by Siri and Mancini, beginning a movement to bring open source to democracy and governance to their native Buenos Aires. From its early origins founding a political party (Argentina’s Internet Party, aka Partido De La Red), the publication of Siri’s book [Hacktivismo (Random House)](https://www.amazon.com/Hacktivismo-alcance-revolucionar-poder-Spanish-ebook/dp/B0101233LE) and a series of global TED Talks in 2015 (Santiago Siri, [How to Upgrade Democracy for the Internet Era](https://www.ted.com/talks/pia_mancini_how_to_upgrade_democracy_for_the_internet_era)), 2016 (Pia Mancini, [The Future of Democracy](https://www.ted.com/talks/pia_mancini_how_to_upgrade_democracy_for_the_internet_era)) and 2017 (DEF UK Ambassador Sunny Sangha, [Is a fair, global democracy possible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsz7MjMJ5J8)) collectively garnering nearly 2 million views, the Democracy Earth mission has been clear and consistent: to build the technology that will bring democracy into the internet age.   

DEF released [Version 1.0 Alpha](https://vote.democracy.earth/) of the DEF governance platform, Sovereign, in May 2017 and its white paper, [The Social Smart Contract](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/blob/master/README.mediawiki#The_Social_Smart_Contract), in September 2017.  The foundation tested its liquid democracy platform in a [Hong Kong CEO vote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=kJohf9HVy1E), plus an October [2016 pilot](https://www.oecd.org/gov/innovative-government/embracing-innovation-in-government-colombia.pdf) as part of the famed Colombia peace referendum, enabling a symbolic vote among the diaspora of ~6 million expatriate Colombians. The pilot enabled  people to vote separately on different parts of the referendum as well as to delegate their votes to more knowledgeable voters, with results revealing important nuances in voter preferences not captured in the referendum. The pilot provides an active demonstration of how fully participatory democracy reduces voter polarization, powerlessness and apathy.

Democracy Earth publishes a quarterly newsletter and [Medium blog “Hacktivism”](https://words.democracy.earth/), with a [Slack channel](http://chat.democracy.earth/) and [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/DemocracyEarth/) of more than 1,200 contributors.
